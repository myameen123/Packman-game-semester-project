## Description

This is a classic Pacman game implemented in Python. The game features a start menu where players can choose to start the game, view the game grid, and access a cheat code list. The game grid is where all the action happens, and players control Pacman to eat pellets, avoid ghosts, and clear the maze. The cheat code list provides additional features and shortcuts for an enhanced gaming experience.
